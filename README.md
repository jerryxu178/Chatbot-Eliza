# Chatbot-Eliza

Chatbot-Eliza is a chatbot that simulates a Rogerian psychotherapist by using pattern matching and word substitution, much like the original ELIZA program that was written in the 1960's. Chatbot-Eliza does not truly understand what is being said in conversations; it simply recognizes speech patterns and constructs replies based on user input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run Chatbot-Eliza, you will need two things:

-Python 2.7
