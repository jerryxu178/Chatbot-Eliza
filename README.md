Chatbot-Eliza

Chatbot-Eliza is a chatbot that simulates a Rogerian psychotherapist by using pattern matching and word substitution, much like the original ELIZA program that was written in the 1960's. Chatbot-Eliza does not truly understand what is being said in conversations; it simply formulates replies by choosing responses from a predetermined script based on what the user says to it.

Setup

To run Chatbot-Eliza, you will need two things:
-Python 2.7
-Git (recommended)

Running the Chatbot

Open the command prompt and, from a directory of your choosing, run the following:

git clone https://github.com/jerryxu178/Chatbot-Eliza.git
cd chatbot-eliza
python eliza.py
